# Amazon Reviews Classification with SparkML  
In this project, I apply the Apache Spark framework to perform text classification of Amazon reviews by Spark ML. This projects demonstrates sentiment analysis of Amazon review data by developing Logistic Regression, Na√Øve Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosted Tree classifiers. I compare the performance of these classifiers by evaluating the classification accuracy. 
This project is written using PySpark and Scala. <br />
