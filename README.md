As many companies create more volumes and varieties of data, there is a growing need for a framework to process and analyze large-scale datasets with parallel and distributed algorithms. Apache Spark is a fast and efficient cluster framework that uses Resilient Distributed Dataset (RDD) to partition large datasets and allows parallel and fast computation of data processing in memory. 
In this project, I apply the Apache Spark framework to perform text classification of Amazon reviews by Spark ML. This projects demonstrates sentiment analysis of Amazon review data by developing Logistic Regression, Na√Øve Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosted Tree classifiers. I compare the performance of these classifiers by evaluating the classification accuracy. 
This project is written using PySpark and Scala. <br />
